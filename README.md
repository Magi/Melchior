# melchior

`melchior` is a wrapper around [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) with specific hooks used by project magi.
How each bit of `melchior` syntax is rendered to html can be overridden--this it the primary purpose of `melchior`.

The project is currently in very early development. Overall structure is likely to change as the project grows.
